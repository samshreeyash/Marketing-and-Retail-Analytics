<u><b>Problem Statement:</b></u>

In the recent past, e-commerce companies have emerged and flourished in the industry. They offer the convenience to order from a wide variety of options from the comfort of one’s home. But how do they offer these “wide variety of options or products”? To be able to meet the demands of the customers, any e-commerce company would obviously need to store tons and tons of products in warehouses. Now, some of these warehoused products might be fast-moving products which sell very quickly and some others might be slow-moving. Each of the products being stored incurs a cost to the company in terms of space and maintenance. Since storing these products obviously add to the costs that the company incurs, it is absolutely necessary for the organisations to plan their inventory well.Now, OList is one such e-commerce company that has faced some losses recently and they want to manage their inventory very well so as to reduce any unnecessary costs that they might be bearing. In this assignment, you have to manage the inventory cost of this e-commerce company OList. You need to identify top products that contribute to the revenue and also use market basket analysis to analyse the purchase behaviour of individual customers to estimate with relative certainty, what items are more likely to be purchased individually or in combination with some other products.
